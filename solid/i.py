ISP: Interface Segregation Principle

The interface segregation principle states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones
so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces.
ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor, change, and redeploy.
